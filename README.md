# battle_boat
The first actual program I ever made. CLI version of Battleship.

I made this while learning from Al Sweitgart's Python book. It's probably got a lot of garbage in it code-wise(for instance, I didn't know you could have arrays within arrays), but I still love it. And I reckon the AI isn't too bad a player!
